I've created a momentum app where you can make a TO-DO-LIST for setting your goals aand make them happen. 

* Minimalist time and weather on the new tab page.
* Keep up with time. 
* Jazz Music (on/off)
* To-do-list
* Local Storage data saved
* weather API

## Set your goals and make them happen
>
1. Decide. Think of something you want to do or work towards. 
2. Write it down carefully. 
3. Tell someone. Telling someone we know about our goals also seems to increase the likelihood that we will stick at them.
4. Break your goal down. This is especially important for big goals. 
   * Use MOMENTUM APP
5. Plan your first step. 
6. Keep going. .
7. Celebrate.
